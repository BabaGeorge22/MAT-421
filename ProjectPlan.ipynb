        "Cardiovascular disease is still one of the leading global causes of death, and is placing significant burdens on healthcare systems. Early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and decrease mortality. The aim of this project is to create a predictive model using logistic regression to classify patients into groups with or without cardiovascular disease, using clinical and demographic variables like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, types of pain in the chest, and other relevant measurements of health. The main practical goal is to enable earlier intervention and individually targeted preventive therapy for at-risk patients."

        "Several studies have used machine learning to predict heart disease. Logistic regression models are favored because of their simplicity and ease of interpretability with medical data. Prior research, has shown that logistic regression can utilize medical data like resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and exercise induced angina to predict whether or not someone has heart disease. Apart from this, other more complex models like neural networks and random forests have also been explored. While these are more prone to provide greater accuracy, they trade off interpretability.\n"
